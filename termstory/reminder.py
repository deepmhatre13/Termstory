    """Detect idle periods (30+ min gaps in command history or since last command)
    and consolidate command contexts into summaries.

    Failure isolation contract (per-cluster recovery):

    Each cluster produced by :func:`cluster_commands` is summarized
    independently. If :func:`generate_cluster_summary` raises for one cluster
    (LLM/provider timeout, malformed response, request failure, or any other
    per-cluster processing error), that exception is contained: the cluster
    contributes no summary this run, sibling clusters keep processing, and the
    chunk is persisted with only the summaries gathered before the failure.
    Persistence failures from ``db.save_consolidated_context()`` are *not*
    swallowed here — they propagate to the caller (a background daemon that
    already logs uncaught exceptions), because a failed write means successful
    work was not committed and must not be reported as consolidated.

    Recovery semantics: ``rem_sleep_consolidation`` has no separate watermark
    column — the next run's eligibility boundary is
    ``MAX(end_time)`` over persisted rows. Eligible commands are strictly those
    newer than that boundary. Consequently:

    - A chunk whose clusters all fail persists nothing, so its commands stay
      eligible and are retried on the next run.
    - A partially-failed chunk is persisted only up to the point of failure:
      summaries for clusters whose commands are all strictly older than every
      command of the earliest failed cluster form a leading chronological
      prefix, which is saved with an ``end_time`` below the earliest failed
      timestamp. The surviving work (the failed cluster's commands onward)
      therefore remains eligible and is retried — overlapping-free, so a
      retry cannot produce duplicate rows for already-persisted windows.
    - Retry idempotency: a run starts after the existing watermark and only
      writes rows ending below it; previously persisted work is never rewritten,
      so no duplicates can be created despite the absence of a uniqueness
      constraint on ``(start_time, end_time)``.

    Returns:
        Number of chunks successfully persisted this run (unchanged meaning).

    """Spawns the sleep daemon in the background if it's not already running.

    Daemon ownership is claimed atomically: the PID file is created with
    ``O_CREAT | O_EXCL`` so that, of any number of concurrent invocations,
    exactly one wins the race and goes on to spawn the daemon. Every other
    invocation finds the file already exists and defers to the running (or
    just-started) daemon, which later overwrites the placeholder PID with its
    own. A stale PID file (a daemon that died without cleaning up) is reclaimed
    so the daemon can be restarted.

    An empty PID file (the winner created it but has not published its
    placeholder PID yet) is treated as a live in-progress claim while it is
    fresh, so concurrent invocations defer to it rather than double-spawn. If
    the creator dies between creating the file and publishing its PID, the file
    is left empty forever; once it is older than ``_DAEMON_CLAIM_GRACE_SECONDS``
    that empty claim is deemed abandoned and reclaimed so the daemon can be
    started again without manual cleanup.
